Go and python may not co-exist since go module sometime yields
core, seems when they receive SIGCHLD.

In addition, nursd can not finalize normally since... go runtime
creates threads and that threads update their signal mask. Main nurs
thread match with that threads to win signals... I think.

I think, this is aliviated by sending signal tid, not tgid. see
contrib/tgkill.c
